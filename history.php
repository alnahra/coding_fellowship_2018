			The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was created in 1934 to regulate housing in the New Deal era.
			One of its primary functions was to insure private mortgages, which allowed Americans to pay for a house with a reduced down payment.
			However, the government decided on which mortgages to back by judging perceived neighborhood stability.
			On paper, the idea was to judge the likelihood of a homeowner to default on their loan by comparing other housing circumstances in the neighborhood.
			The FHA created a system of maps that rated neighborhoods according to their perceived stability, literally drawing different colored lines around different neighborhoods.
			Green areas were labeled “A,” red areas “D,” etc. The classifications were almost entirely founded on race: the more non-whites in an area, the closer to the “D” rating it got.
			Black neighborhoods were consequently ineligible for FHA-backed loans, a standard that soon spread across both the public and private mortgage industry.
		<br><br>
			Adding to the effects of redlining, restrictive zoning enabled white communities to avoid the development of public housing, forcing many black neighborhoods to be tied to the inner city.
			This centralization of African Americans was permitted by federal policies deferring to local governments as to how to spend public housing funds.
			Suburban area authorities refused to participate in government housing programs, strictly enforcing zoning laws that prohibited the division of single-family houses into apartments.
			Whites that could flee these areas did, leading to complete neighborhood segregation that was entirely legal and encouraged by governmental procedure.
		<br><br>
			Residential location determines schooling, public services, libraries, recreation services, and more.
			Because funding for all of these services pulls from local taxes, maintaining socioeconomic and racial homogeneity in areas with these amenities outstanding was imperative to residents.
			This limited public services to the wealthy, white suburbs and functionally removed them from inner-city areas that actually needed the money.

				This voluntary community segregation is the reason why St. Louis has 90 different municipalities in the metropolitan area.
				This practice of secitoning off communities became so commonplace that it is generally accepted as fact that these municipalities should be distinct from each other.
				But having such small areas be their own municipality means that the tax bases for each area are relatively limited, and many of the public services remaining today do not have enough moeny to function.
				They rely on tickets and other incedental sources of revenue to provide police forces, and firefighters, and lots of other services. Even though there might not be a need for six different police departments in a 3 mile radius.
			<br><br>
				But it's really difficult to substantiate these claims, because each municipality stores their information differently.
				It's difficult to compare the spending in one area to another, because the same pot of money could be titled differently between them.
				And matching that spending to revenue from traffic stops and ticket violations is laborious and time-consuming without a standardized database to pull from.
			<br><br>
				That's where this project comes in.
