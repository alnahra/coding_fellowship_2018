			Across the St. Louis City and County region, 66 police departments provide service to 1.31 million
			people over 589 square miles. The demographics of each department do not necessarily represent the demographics of the areas that they
			serve, and each vary by size and resources seemingly distinct from the size or population density of the municipality.
			In total, the St. Louis metropolitan region spends almost $500 million on policing each year.
		<br><br>
			The number of municipalities in a relatively condensed area may seem striking. It should. Champ, Missouri, is a municipality of 11 people.
			And the number of incorporated municipalities does not even cover the unincorporated areas of the region, of which there are several pockets
			that simply exist without formal governmental structures. Many of these municipalities have their own police forces, which cover areas ranging from 0.11 square
			miles to the 265 miles covered by the St. Louis County police force. If you drive from the the Galleria mall to Lambert airport, you drive through fifteen
			different police jurisdictions. The trip won't even take that many minutes.
		<br><br>
			The goal of this project is to provide accessible information about these departmensâ€”who are they, where are they, and how are they run.
			The most immediate goal is to examine how policing services are currently being provided in the St. Louis area, while making that information
			publicly presented in a readable, interesting way. Much of this work builds upon Better Together St. Louis' Police Executive Research Forum,
			researched from, 2014-2015 and available online at <a href='http://www.bettertogetherstl.com/police-study' target="blank">http://www.bettertogetherstl.com/police-study</a>.

		<h2>
			Historical Context
		</h2>
		<br><br><br>
			<div class='post2'>
				St. Louis' history of voluntary community segregation is the reason why 90 different municipalities in the metropolitan area in the first place.
				The practice of sectioning off communities to avoid African Americans from joining neighborhoods became so commonplace that it is simp;y accepted
				as fact that these municipalities should be distinct from each other. There is no reason for the area's fragmentation aside from this history of racism.
				But having such small areas be their own municipality means that the tax bases for each area are relatively limited, and many of the public services remaining today do not have enough moeny to function.
				They rely on tickets and other incedental sources of revenue to provide police forces, and firefighters, and lots of other services. Even though there might not be a need for six different police departments in a 3 mile radius.
			<br><br>
				But it's really difficult to substantiate these claims, because each municipality stores their information differently.
				It's difficult to compare the spending in one area to another, because the same pot of money could be titled differently between them.
				And matching that spending to revenue from traffic stops and ticket violations is laborious and time-consuming without a standardized database to pull from.
			<br><br>
				That's where this project comes in.
